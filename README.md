# Non-linear-Data-Struct.-Alg.
For an assignment we had to implement some of the methods for a binary search tree, Adjacency List and Adjacency Matrix. Not all of the code is mine, our lecturer implemented some of the methods for us to use for the assignment. All methods with a comment to do or assignment: are my own.
